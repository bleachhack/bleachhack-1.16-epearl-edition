## Installation
### For normal people

Download [fabric for minecraft 1.16/1.17](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

Download my skid version [from the releases section](https://github.com/HerraVp/BleachHack-VpEdition/releses).


On Windows: Type %appdata% into the Windows search bar; open the folder that comes up and then open '.minecraft'.

On Mac: Click on the desktop, press Command+Shift+G, type ~/Library and press enter; then open 'Application Support' and finally '.minecraft'.

On Linux: in a terminal window, type 'xdg-open ~/.minecraft'... or if you like working at the commandline, 'cd ~/.minecraft'.

Then inside that folder, you should see a folder named 'mods'. (If you don't see one, make sure you've installed Fabric already and started Minecraft again once).
That's where you'll put any mods you want to install.

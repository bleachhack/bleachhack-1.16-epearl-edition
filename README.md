My own skid of BleachHack.


Works on fabric 1.16.5 and 1.17

## About 1.16 version of the client
1.16.5 version of the client isn't going to be updated anymore.

I will only focus on the 1.17 version of the client now.

U can use [viaFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viafabric) to use the 1.17 version of the client on 1.16.
